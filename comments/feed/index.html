		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll second Peter&#039;s comment, and clear up some of the mis-information you&#039;ve provided on the Scarlet.

SENSOR: 14 Megapixel Mysterium-X
CODEC: you do not &quot;require&quot; a Red Rocket card, refer to Peter&#039;s post.
AUDIO: There are two 3.5mm Jack&#039;s in the front of the camera that provide on-board recording. This is compatible with an array of Microphones or you can find a 3rd Party adaptor (Such as a Wooden Camera A-Box) to provide a dual XLR solution. While there is no Microphone built in, your wording leaves the assumption that it is not capable of recording audio, at all.
MOUNT: Nikon available as well.

In the future, please do your research a bit more thoroughly, with out it, people begin to get the wrong idea during their search.

Also, the RED DRAGON starts at $29,000 for the brain only. If you&#039;d prefer on spending 50K, you&#039;re looking at a Carbon Fiber edition, with some accessories. (Side SSD + Lens Mount)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Aaron. the holes on the cage are threaded. 

Because of the weight of the camera, I wouldn&#039;t advise to put a lot of weight on the top, it will make it top-heavy and there will be vibrations. 

When it&#039;s fully kitted, I find the cage to be extremely solid and reliable. Highly recommended. Thanks Aaron]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You listing that a the Red Scarlet requires a Rocket card is inaccurate. You don&#039;t need it to play back. You only need to have an NLE that support playback which pretty much includes all of them at this point. If you have Premiere CS6 or above and a CUDA enabled card installed you can get full debayer and close to Red Rocket transcoding speeds through Redcine-X for a 10th the cost as it supports CUDA cards now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I was wondering if any of the holes on this cage are threaded (I would assume so, but I don&#039;t like to assume). I shoot run and gun stuff as well and would need to be able to add a mic and recorder and the top shoe I would be using for a monitor. My other question is since this isn&#039;t really a shoulder rig, how do you find using the camera fully kitted (matte box, monitor, follow focus, etc) when its in your two hands?  Thanks for your review!]]></description>
