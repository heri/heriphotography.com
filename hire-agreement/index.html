<p>The following terms and conditions apply to the <a href="../camera-rental-montreal/index.html">hire of all equipment</a> from HeriPhotography Hire.</p>
<p>Bad things can happen, and most of the time it isn&#8217;t because our customers meant it to (you&#8217;re a lovely bunch, after all), but we both need to know where we stand should something go wrong.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, or would like to discuss any aspect of the hire agreement, get in touch and we&#8217;ll help clarify.</p>
<p><strong>v1.2 &#8211; Effective From December 22, 2013</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Equipment means any camera, lens, or other device together with any accessories, instructions or other accompanying documents specified in a Contract which are available for hire to a Customer;</li>
<li>Hire Period means the period of hire of the Equipment to the Customer as agreed by the parties to a Contract;</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>2. Basis of Contract</h3>
<ul>
<li>2.1 Subject to circumstances arising pursuant to the rest of condition 2, a Contract binds the parties once a Customer is told by the Supplier that their Booking has been confirmed.</li>
<li>2.2 In circumstances where the Supplier has provided written confirmation pursuant to condition 2.1, but the Equipment for reasons outside the Supplier’s control, ceases to be available for the whole of the Hire Period, the Supplier shall inform the Customer as soon as practicable.</li>
<li>2.3 In circumstances envisaged in condition 2.2, the Supplier will use reasonable endeavours to provide suitable replacement equipment in order to fulfill the Contract subject always in the event of unavailability of all or part of a booking to a Customer’s right
<ul>
<li>i) to cancel the whole or part of the booking and receive a full refund or a part thereof, as applicable; or</li>
<li>ii) to re-schedule the whole or part of the booking at no extra charge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>3. Price and Payment</h3>
<ul>
<li>3.1 While the Supplier does not usually require a Deposit, the Customer acknowledges that each hire transaction may be subject to a Deposit at the discretion of the Supplier.</li>
<li>3.2 The amount of such Deposit and/or Rental and/or charges for any Services shall be as quoted to the Customer or shall be as otherwise shown on the Supplier’s web site from time to time.</li>
<li>3.3 In respect of any applicable Deposit, the Supplier shall reserve a sum equal to the Deposit on the Customer’s credit or debit card when the Equipment reserved by a booking is collected.

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>4. Collection and Return of Equipment</h3>
<ul>
<li>4.1 The Customer accepts that, due to the time and complexity involved in performing a thorough check of returned Equipment for damage, the Supplier will not perform its checks of returned Equipment immediately upon return by the Customer. Because of this, such checks will not be performed in the presence of the Customer.</li>
<li>4.2 Where the Equipment is not returned to the Supplier within 5 days following the end of the Hire Period and the Customer has failed to either:
<ul>
<li>i) contact the Supplier and explain the circumstances of the default; or</li>
<li>ii) negotiate an extension to the Hire Period with the Supplier who has provided written confirmation of such an extension,</li>
</ul>
<p>the Supplier will report the Equipment stolen and will take steps for recovery including but not limited to charging the Customer’s credit or debit card for the full price of replacement Equipment and a fee equal to the applicable Rental until suitable replacement Equipment has been acquired and commissioned for service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>5. Responsibility and Ownership</h3>

</li>
<li>
<h3>6. Care of Equipment</h3>
<ul>
<li>6.1 The Customer shall:-

<li>7.4 In the event that the Equipment is lost, stolen or damaged during the Possession Period, the Customer shall pay the Rental in full up to and including the date it notifies the Supplier that the Equipment has been lost, stolen or damaged. From that date until the Supplier has repaired or replaced such Equipment the Customer shall pay, as a genuine pre-estimate of lost rental income, a sum as liquidated damages being equal to the Rental that would have applied for such Equipment for that period. The Supplier shall use its reasonable commercial endeavours to procure repairs or replacements for such Equipment as quickly as possible using the monies paid under conditions 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3.</li>
<li>7.5 In the event that any monies are owed under conditions 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 or 7.4, the Customer authorises the Supplier to charge the Customer&#8217;s debit or credit card, where such details are held by the Supplier, for the total sum owed or part thereof.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>8.4 No-shows will incur a charge of the full Rental of the Booking.</li>
<li>8.5 The Customer agrees to make cancellations as early as possible so that other Customers have the opportunity to hire the Equipment instead.</li>
<li>8.6 No refund is given for the early return of Equipment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>11. General</h3>
<ul>
<li>11.1 Each hire of an item of Equipment shall form a distinct Contract which shall be separate to any other Contract relating to other Equipment.</li>
<li>11.2 No variation to the Contract shall be valid unless it is in writing and signed by or on behalf of both the Customer and the Supplier by a duly authorised officer of the parties.</li>
<li>11.3 The Customer shall not, or purport to, assign its rights or transfer or subcontract any of its rights or obligations under the Contract without the prior written consent of the Supplier.</li>
<li>11.4 The Customer shall be liable, where applicable, for the acts and/or omissions of its employees, agents, servants and/or subcontractors as though they were its own acts and/or omissions under this Contract.</li>
<li>11.5 The Customer agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified the Supplier against any and all losses, lost profits, damages, claims, costs (including legal costs on a full indemnity basis), actions and any other losses and/or liabilities suffered by the Supplier and arising from or due to any breach of contract, any tortious act and/or omission and/or any breach of statutory duty by the Customer.</li>
<li>11.6 No waiver by the Supplier of any breach of this Contract shall be considered as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same provision or any other provision.</li>
<li>11.7 If any provision is held by any competent authority to be unenforceable in whole or in part the validity of the other provisions of this Contract and the remainder of the affected provision shall be unaffected and shall remain in full force and effect.</li>
<li>11.8 The Supplier shall have no Liability to the Customer for any delay and/or non performance of a Contract to the extent that such delay or non-performance is due to any Force Majeure Event.</li>
<li>11.9 These Terms and Conditions together with the other agreed terms comprising the Contract and any document expressly referred to in any of its terms contains the entire agreement between the Customer and the Supplier relating to the subject matter covered and supersedes any previous agreements, arrangements, undertakings or proposals, written or oral, in relation to such matters. No oral explanation or oral information given by either the Customer or the Supplier shall alter the interpretation of the Terms &amp; Conditions or the Contract.</li>
<li>11.10 The Customer agrees that the only remedy available to it for breach of any term expressly set out in the Contract shall be a breach of contract. Nothing contained in this condition 11.10 shall however operate to limit or exclude any liability of the Customer for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>
<li>11.11 Subject to condition 11.12, all third party rights are excluded and no third parties shall have any rights to enforce the Contract.</li>
<li>11.12 Without prejudice to the generality of condition 11.11 a finance company with whom the Supplier has an outstanding finance agreement relating to the Equipment shall, subject to the Supplier’s consent, have the right to enforce this Contract as if they were the Supplier and the Supplier’s written notice to the Customer of the interest of any finance company in the Equipment shall be binding and conclusive evidence of the same.</li>
<li>11.13 This Contract is governed by and interpreted in accordance with Quebec law and the parties agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Quebec courts.</li>
