		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll second Peter&#039;s comment, and clear up some of the mis-information you&#039;ve provided on the Scarlet.

SENSOR: 14 Megapixel Mysterium-X
CODEC: you do not &quot;require&quot; a Red Rocket card, refer to Peter&#039;s post.
AUDIO: There are two 3.5mm Jack&#039;s in the front of the camera that provide on-board recording. This is compatible with an array of Microphones or you can find a 3rd Party adaptor (Such as a Wooden Camera A-Box) to provide a dual XLR solution. While there is no Microphone built in, your wording leaves the assumption that it is not capable of recording audio, at all.
MOUNT: Nikon available as well.

In the future, please do your research a bit more thoroughly, with out it, people begin to get the wrong idea during their search.

Also, the RED DRAGON starts at $29,000 for the brain only. If you&#039;d prefer on spending 50K, you&#039;re looking at a Carbon Fiber edition, with some accessories. (Side SSD + Lens Mount)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You listing that a the Red Scarlet requires a Rocket card is inaccurate. You don&#039;t need it to play back. You only need to have an NLE that support playback which pretty much includes all of them at this point. If you have Premiere CS6 or above and a CUDA enabled card installed you can get full debayer and close to Red Rocket transcoding speeds through Redcine-X for a 10th the cost as it supports CUDA cards now.]]></description>
